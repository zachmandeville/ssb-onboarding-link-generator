# Introduction to the Command Line

Before the metaphor of a "desktop" was created to make computers sellable as a business device, interacting with the computer was largely a text-based, conversational experience.  You would ask your computer about things, or whether it could do things for you, and it would respond with the answer or the finished task.  The community working  with computers was a smaller group than today, and fairly strange...so the language and style of this dialogue was strange too. 

Incredibly, this style of computing, this language and dialoge based world, has persisted to today in the form of the command line, which is available on most computers.  If you are on a mac or linux, you can access this world through the terminal application.  If you are on windows, it's available through Powershell.  By working with the command line, you get to interact with a world of pure language, where clever hacking is essentially wordplay.   Nearly everything you can do from your destkop  can be done in the command line, and there's an incredible amount of things you can do on the command line that you _can't_ do on the desktop.

What I love about the command line is that it's not a separate program or place on your computer.  Rather, it's an alternate way of _interacting_ with your computer.  It lets you see your machine in an entirely new light, with more context and control.  Moving to the command line engenders a familiarity and comfort with your machine that feels similar to when you move to a new neighborhood and subtly transition from "new neighbor" to "local".

On top of this, learning how to navigate the command line is actually learning _the language_ of it, and this language has different dialects on different operating systems, but is largely the same.  Which means that anything you learn to do on your computer can move with you to any other device.  Learning to talk to your computer will help you learn how to talk to your web server, or smart refrigerator, or raspberry pi.  It's a set of tools that requires no money, nor any particular program to run, since the tools are in the phrases themselves.

_And on top of this_, there's a whole culture of folks who create programs that exist as just language, and have no visual counterpart.  In other words, programs that can _only_ be run on the command line, because they were never visualized--they remain as sentences instead of buttons.  And since you are learning the fundamentals of this language, you can learn how to change the sentences of these applications too. It's a whole level of customization, and empowerment, that is just _cool_.

Here's some handy things to remember, when working with or reading about the command line:

* people often abbreviate 'the command line' to CLI, which stands for command line interface.
* Similarly, people often call the whole desktop, icons, mouse interactions the "General User Interface" shortened to GUI (and pronounced goooooooey)
* You don't have to learn every command possible.  That'd take forever, and would likely have a negative effect on your skills.  And this tutorial is not intended to turn you into a hacker keyboard witch right away, so don't worry if it feels alien or overwhelming now. 
* The best advice is to learn, and use, a few simple commands.  Even a small set will open up worlds for you, and these skills don't go away.  You can just slowly expand upon the list of commands, the phrases you know to say.  To extend the cooking metaphor, this guide is not expecting you to learn an entire cookbook, it's showing you how to cook scrambled eggs. You'll learn more complex recipes later, but knowing how to scramble an egg will always be useful.

## Finding the Command Line
Mac and Linux it's called the terminal.  
Mac, you can go to applications>utilities>terminal
Linux will be different depending on the distro you're using, but linux as a whole is pretty _pro_ the command line, and so the terminal will most likely be _prominent_
Windows uses a different version that is a sort of linguistic cousin to the mac/linux command line.  For windows it's called the Command Prompt, and can be found within applications.
(quick note: I am familiar with the mac/linux flavor of the command line, but have not used Windows command prompt.  I am putting details here to be helpful, but if you are using windows and the details don't make sense I would highly recommend checking out other resouces than this one.  Taming the Terminal (linked at the bottom) has good tutorials for Windows.  I am not saying this to be snooty or unhelpful, I just don't wanna pretend to know a thing I don't!)
